It runs an analysis of the field and laboratory data to compare the operation of a 4-ton residential split system heat pump on AC and DC power sources.

The file pv_util.py is a python script which simulates the annual operation of the heat pump on AC and DC for comparison. Efficiency curves are used to calculate the conversion losses on AC and DC nanogrids.
